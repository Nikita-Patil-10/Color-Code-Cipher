🎨 Color Code Cipher – Visual Cryptography
   A visual cryptography web project that transforms text into colorful encrypted patterns using a modified Caesar Cipher concept.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project offers a fun and interactive way to understand the basics of encryption and decryption in cryptography.

🔐 Overview

In this project, each character of the input text is shifted based on a key value (as in the Caesar Cipher algorithm) and converted into a hexadecimal color code.
This creates a beautiful visual pattern — a creative way to see encrypted data as colors!

🧠 Features

✅ Encrypts plain text into color codes
✅ Decrypts colors back to the original message
✅ Simple and interactive single-page UI
✅ Based on the classical Caesar Cipher logic
✅ Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only


⚙ How It Works

Encryption Steps:

1. Take input text and key value.
2. Convert each character into its ASCII code.
3. Shift it by the key and convert it to hexadecimal.
4. Display the corresponding color code visually.

Decryption Steps:

1. Read each color code’s hexadecimal value.
2. Convert back to ASCII after subtracting the key.
3. Recover the original text.
 

🖼 Sample Example

Input:
Text: HELLO  
Key: 3

Output:
A grid of colors generated based on the encrypted values — each color represents one character.
When “Decrypt” is clicked, the text HELLO reappears.
